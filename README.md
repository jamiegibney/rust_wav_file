# Wav file in pure Rust
This is a simple project which creates four .wav files containing 3-second long sine waves at 440 Hz. The resulting .wav files are 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit files.

### TODO
- [ ] allow command line args to change the bit depth, frequency, duration, and amplitude 
- [ ] add support for multi-channel files (sample interleaving, etc.)
